# DecimalQuest — Decimals Using Convert Fractions

A gamified, narrated Grade 4 math module building fluency converting between
fractions and decimals (tenths and hundredths), built on the same five-phase
architecture (Wonder → Story → Simulate → Play → Reflect) as the
`equal-groups-main` reference module. Aligned to Singapore MOE Primary 4
Mathematics syllabus.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build       # production build → dist/
npm run preview     # preview the production build locally
```

## What's in this module

- **Wonder** — 5 curiosity-hook questions about fractions and decimals, one
  shown per visit.
- **Story** — "The Great Pizza Decimal Challenge," a 4-slide narrated story
  introducing tenths and hundredths through Ethan, Mia, and Tally the Owl.
  Ships with placeholder illustrations sized 1672×941px (16:9) — see
  `src/assets/story/README.md` for the exact art brief per slide when your
  final artwork is ready; drop in replacement files with no code changes
  needed.
- **Simulate** — three hands-on stations, all with larger text/tap targets
  for readability: Grid Shader (tap-to-shade a tenths strip or hundredths
  grid → identify the decimal), Flip the Decimal (equivalent-fraction /
  same-decimal challenges), Decimal Sentence (fill-in-the-blank, number pad,
  tenths only).
- **Play** — 100 procedurally generated questions across 10 question types
  (tenths ↔ decimals, hundredths ↔ decimals, common equivalent fractions,
  place value, comparing decimals, decimal patterns, true/false, mixed boss
  review), spread over 10 themed worlds (10 questions each), in 4 play modes
  (Guided, Independent, Timed, Boss Battle). Distractors are built from real
  Grade 4 misconceptions (e.g. writing 7/100 as 0.7 instead of 0.07). Text
  and buttons are enlarged here too, for easier reading and tapping during
  gameplay.
- **Reflect** — a 5-question recap quiz, a confidence check-in, and a summary
  of key takeaways.

Per the module spec, **only Simulate and Play use the enlarged font sizes /
touch targets** — Wonder, Story, Intro, and Reflect keep the original
reference-module sizing untouched.

## Audio pipeline

This module uses the same ElevenLabs-only narration pipeline as the
reference module (Alice voice, no browser-TTS fallback). `src/utils/
audioMap.js` ships intentionally empty — no API key was available in this
build environment — and narration silently skips; the app works perfectly
fine without it.

To generate narration audio:

1. Add `VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key_here` to a `.env.local` file in the
   project root.
2. Run `npm run generate-audio`. This hits the ElevenLabs API for every
   phrase in `scripts/generate_audio.js`, saves `.mp3` files to
   `public/assets/audio/`, and rewrites `src/utils/audioMap.js`.
3. If you ever edit narration text in `src/utils/narration.js`, update the
   matching entry in `scripts/generate_audio.js`'s `phrases` array, re-run
   the generator, then optionally run `npm run clean-audio` to delete any
   now-orphaned `.mp3` files.

## Deployment

Deploys cleanly to Vercel (or any static host) — `vite.config.js` uses
`base: '/'` for a root deploy. Run `npm run build` and upload `dist/`.
